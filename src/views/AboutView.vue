        AlliedExchange is an initiative by AlliedOffsets to improve transparency
        in the carbon markets. We aim to facilitate the distribution of offers
        both to the potential end buyers, but also to other intermediaries
        including exchanges and OTC brokers.<br /><br />

        Those offering credits for sale decide the distribution channel for each
        project.
        <br /><br />

        The “firm” credits offered for sale by the project developers are
        reserved/blocked at a registry level such that the project can’t sell
        those credits elsewhere, unless the offer is amended or cancelled.
